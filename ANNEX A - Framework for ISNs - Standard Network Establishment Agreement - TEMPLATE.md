Each Network Participant shall, upon request by the Network Executive Committee, at its own cost provide such information and assistance to the Network Executive Committee as the Network Executive Committee may reasonably request, to enable the Network Executive Committee to comply with its obligations under this Agreement.

12. **COMPETITION LAW REQUIREMENTS**

    1. The Network Participants will at all times have regard to Clause 26 and in particular:

       1. ensure that that the Network Purpose is clearly defined, along with the parameters for the nature of the data, how it is collected, how it is shared and how it is used and ensure that these parameters (and any changes to them) are regularly reviewed for compliance with Competition Law;

       2. agree a framework for allowing open, fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory access to the Network and the data collected (as set out in Clauses 26.2.2 and 26.2.3); 

       3. to the extent that any Network will have two or more Network Participants which are actual or potential competitors ensure that adequate governance is in place to avoid the exchange of Commercially Sensitive Information between them. 

    2. With respect to Commercially Sensitive Information, in order to minimise the Competition Law risk, Network Participants will consider whether it is necessary to: 

       1. anonymise and/or or aggregate the data before it is shared with competing Network Participants; and/or 

       2. share only historic data with competing Network Participants; and/or 

       3. establish information firewalls to limit access to any Commercially Sensitive Information either between the competing Network Participants or within those Network Participants' organisations so that those individuals who are responsible for setting the competing Network Participants' commercial strategy do not have access to the Commercially Sensitive Information (so called 'clean team arrangements').

    3. If any Network Participant suspects that any Commercially Sensitive Information has been (inadvertently or otherwise) disclosed to a competitor, it must immediately inform the Network Executive Committee and its legal advisors and consider steps to ensure that such Commercially Sensitive Information is deleted and otherwise not used.  

    **Commercially Sensitive Information**

    4. Competition Law prohibits the exchange of Commercially Sensitive Information between actual or potential competitors. **Commercially Sensitive Information** means any information which is: (i) not otherwise in the public domain and; (ii) would be strategically useful to the recipient, for example by reducing uncertainty about the provider's strategy and/or providing a competitive advantage to the recipient. 

    5. Commercially Sensitive Information may include recent, current, or future:

       1. costs; 

       2. prices and pricing policies; 

       3. profitability of product lines; 

       4. marketing or product development plans; 

       5. information on ongoing or expected projects; 

       6. customer-specific items or customer lists; 

       7. trade secrets; and 

       8. non-public information relating to R\&D or intellectual property rights. 

13. **INTELLECTUAL Property Rights**

    1. Nothing in this Agreement transfers title to Background IPRs.

    2. Foreground IPRs shall be owned by the Network Participant or Network Participants generating such Foreground IPRs.

    3. Except as expressly set out in this Agreement, no Network Participant will acquire any right, title or interest in or to the Intellectual Property Rights of any information that other Network Participants have made available to, or is accessed by, that Network Participant pursuant to this Agreement.

    4. If two or more Network Participants are by operation of law joint owners of Foreground IPRs (**Joint Owners** and **Joint Foreground IPRs** respectively) then:-

       1. each Joint Owner may use such Joint Foreground IPRs for the fulfilment of the Network Purpose and for its own internal business and operational purposes;

       2. no Joint Owner may commercialise the Joint Foreground IPRs or sell products manufactured with, or incorporating the Joint Foreground IPRs, or sell services using the Joint Foreground IPRs without the prior written consent of all other Joint Owners; and

       3. no Joint Owner may either grant a licence to the Joint Foreground IPRs, or assign its interest in the Joint Foreground IPRs to any third party without the prior written consent of all other Joint Owners.

    5. Subject always to the provisions of Clause 22, each Disclosing Network Participant hereby grants to each Receiving Network Participant to whom it has agreed, in accordance with Clause 10.1.1, to make available Background Information pursuant to this Agreement, a non-exclusive royalty-free personal non-assignable licence (without any right to grant sub-licences) under the Background IPR to use the Background Information and Background IPRs solely for the purposes of carrying out the activities or operations of the Network and/or, to the extent consistent with the Network Purpose and the provisions of Clauses 16.3 and 16.4, for its own internal business and operational purposes. All licences granted under this Clause 13.5 shall terminate automatically on termination of this Agreement.

14. **EXPLOITATION Of Foreground IPRs**

    1. Each Network Participant shall be responsible for the commercial exploitation of any Foreground IPRs generated or conceived solely by that Network Participant and shall, subject to any obligations of confidentiality owed to a third party, inform the Network Executive Committee.

    2. If more than one Joint Owner wishes to exploit Joint Foreground IPR, the relevant Joint Owners shall agree between them as to which should lead on such exploitation, provided that if agreement cannot be reached the matter shall be referred to the Network Executive Committee for determination.

    3. The Joint Owners undertake to share all revenue or other payments received in connection with the exploitation of Joint Foreground IPRs in proportion to the respective contributions and efforts of each Joint Owner to the creation of the relevant Joint Foreground IPRs, to be agreed on by the relevant Network Participants at that time, after deduction of actual and reasonable costs of protection and commercialisation.

15. **Protection Of Intellectual Property**

    1. Decisions on whether any Foreground IPRs should be protected by patent or other intellectual property protection and the costs of filing and protection of such patent application(s) or other protection shall be made and paid for respectively by the Network Participant generating such Foreground IPRs. In the case of protection of Joint Foreground IPRs, the cost of such protection shall be paid by the Joint Owners in proportion to their relative contributions and efforts. The Joint Owners shall discuss any such protection that should be sought and shall use all reasonable endeavours to reach agreement in relation thereto.

       2. any Information which is derived by two or more Receiving Network Participants through the use of and/or access to Background Information in accordance with Clauses 16.5.1 and/or 16.5.3 shall constitute Foreground Information pertaining to those Receiving Network Participants jointly ("**Joint Foreground Information**");

       3. any Information other than Foreground Information which is derived by a Receiving Network Participant through the use of and/or access to Background Information shall be deemed to constitute Background Information; 

       4. any Information other than Foreground Information derived by a Receiving Network Participant through the use and/or access of Background Information made available by two or more Disclosing Network Participants, shall be deemed to constitute Background Information of each of those Disclosing Network Participants individually and in common.

    9. Each Network Participant shall, when it makes any use and/or disclosure of Network Information, and at the request of the Disclosing Network Participant, expressly acknowledge the source of the Network Information and attribute the contribution of the Disclosing Network Participant, including any source(s) of Background Information and associated details specified by the Disclosing Network Participant.

    10. Without prejudice to Clauses 16.3 and 16.5, where the Receiving Network Participant discloses or gives access to any Background Information to a third party, it shall procure that such third party complies with and gives full effect to this Clause 16, including by as soon as practicable executing such documents and performing such acts as may reasonably be required for this purpose. This Clause 16.10 shall not apply to third party providers of the Receiving Network Participant's core business systems (and related ancillary services such as IT maintenance and support) provided that no bulk transfer of Background Information is made to such third parties.

    11. The Receiving Network Participant shall be responsible to the Disclosing Network Participant for the use and/or disclosure of Background Information by third parties to whom it discloses or gives access to Background Information, including any unauthorised use or disclosure attributable to an act or default of the Receiving Network Participant.

    12. The Network Participants agree that only the Receiving Network Participant which derives Foreground Information in accordance with Clause 16.8 shall have the right to determine how that Foreground Information may be used and disclosed by any person, in whole or in part (whether substantial or insubstantial), provided that, notwithstanding such right, the use and disclosure of Foreground Information shall be subject to the limitations set out in this Agreement.

    13. Foreground Information and Joint Foreground Information shall only be used and/or disclosed in accordance with Clauses 13.4 and 14, whereby:

Each of the Network Participants acknowledges and agrees that it does not enter into this Agreement on the basis of and does not rely, and has not relied upon, and will have no remedy in respect of, any statement or representation or warranty or other provision made, given or agreed to by the other Network Participants to this Agreement (whether negligently or innocently made) except those expressly set out in or repeated or referred to in this Agreement and the only remedy available in respect of any misrepresentation or untrue statement made to it will be a claim for breach of contract under this Agreement. Accordingly, each of the Network Participants hereby waives any and all other remedies available to it at law (whether under statute, common law or otherwise) in respect of any such misrepresentation or untrue statement. Nothing in this Agreement will operate to limit or exclude liability for any fraudulent misrepresentation, statement or act.

    8. This Agreement shall not be capable of being varied, modified, altered or substituted, except by prior written agreement of all of the Network Participants.

    9. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by each of the parties on separate counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original, but all the counterparts together shall constitute one and the same agreement. No counterpart shall be effective until each party has executed and delivered at least one counterpart.

    10. Each party agrees that they may sign this Agreement by electronic signature (whatever form the electronic signature takes) and that this method of signature is as conclusive of the parties' intention to be bound by this Agreement as if signed by each party's manuscript signature. Transmission of the executed signature page of a counterpart of this Agreement by e-mail (in PDF, JPEG, PNG. BMP, TIFF or any other agreed format) shall take effect as delivery of an executed counterpart of this Agreement.

    11. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, a person who is not a party to this Agreement shall have no rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to rely upon or enforce any term of this Agreement.

    12. No forbearance, delay or indulgence by any of the Network Participants in enforcing any of the provisions of this Agreement will prejudice or restrict the rights of that Network Participant or those Network Participants, nor will any waiver of its or their rights operate as a waiver of any subsequent breach.  No right, power or remedy conferred in this Agreement on, or reserved for, any of the Network Participants is exclusive of any other right, power or remedy available to that Network Participant or those Network Participants.

30. **Dispute Resolution**

    1. All disputes which shall at any time arise between the Network Participants hereto which cannot be resolved shall in the first place (and prior to commencement of any litigation or other proceedings) be referred to senior management (or their appointed nominees) of the disputing Network Participants for a joint decision.

    2.
